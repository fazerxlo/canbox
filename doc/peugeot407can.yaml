            Notes:  The *raw value* is in byte 0.  The *final calculation* of the fuel level in percent, according to `PSAVanCanBridge`, involves:

                    `max_fuel    = (msg[3] >> 1) & 0x7F;`  // Extract 7 bits.
                    `if (max_fuel != 0) { fuel_percent =  (uint8_t)(((uint32_t)fuel_level * 100) / max_fuel); }`

    Signals:
    * Many unknown signals.  You've included placeholders in `peugeot407can.yaml`, but no handler functions.
    * Need to be investigated using CAN logs.  The `PSACAN.md` might offer some clues.
    Notes:  You'll need to create separate handler functions for these IDs (e.g., `peugeot_407_ms_260_handler`, `peugeot_407_ms_261_handler`) and add them to the `peugeot_407_ms` array.

    Signals:  8 ASCII characters (Bytes 0-7)
    Notes:  You have included placeholders for this in your `peugeot407can.yaml`, but it's not used in the C code yet.  You'll need to create a handler and likely store this data in a separate string buffer in `carstate`.
